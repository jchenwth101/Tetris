# Tetris
A python program to emulate the classic puzzle game "Tetris"

To Run:
From an IDE (such as jetbrains Pycharm) import pygame, paste code into new file called "tetris.py", and run.
else:
try pasting code and running on an online pycharm simulator like , or https://trinket.io/features/pygame or https://replit.com/@jchenwth/tetris#main.py
However,
a personal IDE would be best if it supports the pygame package.  Thanks...Have fun!
